# rotating-wheel-effect-using-HTML-and-CSS

Overview
This project demonstrates a visually engaging rotating wheel effect using HTML and CSS. The wheel is divided into four equal segments colored red, green, blue, and yellow, which rotate forward when hovered over and then rotate backward when the mouse leaves. The design features a transparent center to enhance the visual appeal.
Features
Rotating Wheel: The wheel spins continuously while hovered.
Colorful Segments: Four equal segments with distinct colors (red, green, blue, yellow).
Smooth Animation: Uses CSS animations for smooth transitions between forward and backward rotations.
Responsive Design: The wheel is centered in the viewport and maintains its proportions.
Technologies Used

Code Explanation
HTML Structure
The HTML consists of a main container (wheel-container) that holds the rotating wheel (wheel). Inside the wheel, there are four segments that are visually represented using a conic gradient.
CSS Styling
The CSS styles the body to center the wheel vertically and horizontally. The wheel uses a conic gradient to create colored segments, and a transparent center is created using a pseudo-element (::after).
Animation Keyframes
Two keyframe animations are defined for forward and backward rotation. The wheel spins forward while hovered and spins backward when not hovered.
Usage
Simply hover over the wheel to see it spin forward.
Move your mouse away to see it reverse direction.
